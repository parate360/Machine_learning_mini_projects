1.Classification Accuracy Percentage of correct class predictions out of total predictions. 

2.Regression Accuracy Measured using error metrics like MAE, MSE, or RÂ² instead of direct "accuracy."  

3.Clustering Accuracy Evaluated using metrics like Silhouette Score or Adjusted Rand Index, since true labels may be unknown.
